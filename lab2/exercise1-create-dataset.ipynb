    "## Exercise 1: Create a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, we have used the CIFAR-10 dataset from Keras. Every script started by preprocessing this dataset into a subset with the four classes that we chose. Because CIFAR-10 is quite small, this doesn't take much time, so it didn't bother us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a gigantic dataset. This is quite normal when you are doing machine learning in the real world. Preprocessing it takes a long time, so we really don't want to do it for every training experiment. What's the solution? ClearML Datasets!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a dataset in ClearML for our subset of CIFAR-10. This is done by running a script to preprocess the data, write it to the file system, and then upload it to ClearML. We need to write data to files first because ClearML datasets are always created from files. You can write any Python data to files using `pickle.dump()`, or when you have NumPy arrays, use `numpy.save()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a ClearML dataset use `Dataset.create()`:\n",

    "\n",
    "Afterward, go to the ClearML website, click on DATASETS on the left side, and find the dataset you just created.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't do this now, but later we can use [Dataset.get()](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/references/sdk/dataset/#datasetget) to download our new dataset before training."
